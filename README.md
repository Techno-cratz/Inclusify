# Inclusify
A Hack The North project which attempts to bring inclusiveness to the ever growing world of communication.

### Inspiration
The world of online communication is growing faster than ever, with some countries quintupling internet users every 5 years [1 https://www.statista.com/statistics/792074/india-internet-penetration-rate/]. With this accelerated growth, it is imperative to maintain inclusivity in social media to ensure everyone has equal access to the connected world. However, social media inclusivity is not growing as fast as social media connectivity. Inclusivity hopes to bridge that gap by making social media posts more inclusive.
